# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing e-commerce data to uncover insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using MySQL and Tableau.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the raw dataset to ensure data quality.
- Explore the data to identify patterns and trends.
- Create insightful visualizations to aid in decision-making.

## Dataset
